In order to modify, add, delete or do anything with data inside buckets, is necessary to use the device function.

To setup an device object, you need a token (that you need to get in our website). Make sure to use tokens with correct write/read previlegies for the currenct function you want to use. For example, token with only read previlegies can't create, modify or delete anything from a device.
